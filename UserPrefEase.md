I hope this message finds you well. I am currently working on a project called "UserPrefEase," which is a sophisticated user preference form designed to collect and manage user preferences efficiently. The form includes various features such as profile picture upload with preview, interest and favorite product inputs, multiple notification preferences, favorite category selections, and date of birth selection with a user-friendly date picker. Additionally, it supports dark mode toggling, real-time form validation, and a confirmation modal for form submission.
I am reaching out to invite you to contribute to this project by enhancing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codebase. Your expertise in frontend development will be invaluable in refining the form's functionality, design, and overall user experience. Together, we can make "UserPrefEase" a robust and elegant solution for managing user preferences.
